### How I got into Coding/Tech
As a teen, I taught myself how to make little websites and really loved the creativity involved. I put that interest to the side when I decided to pursue a career in medicine, but after nearly 10 years as a doctor I felt I needed something different. A free online coding workshop popped up on my instagram feed one day, and I thought 'why not?'. From there, I caught the coding bug, got stuck into lots of online coding tutorials and then took the step to attend an in-person coding bootcamp. 
I love the combination of logical, technical thinking with a bit of creativity that you get to use when you solve problems and write code.
I really hope to bring my unique perspective coming from a career in medicine into the tech world.
